#Tappalka
##Overview
Our team has developed an interactive game where users can play and earn tapping scores. The objective is to score a minimum of 30 points within 60 seconds to pass the threshold and earn a free spin in the Bravo Case from CS-2.

##Gameplay
###Welcome Screen: Upon opening the game, the user is greeted with a welcome page, where they can initiate the tapping game.

###Tapping Challenge: The goal is to tap on the circles as they appear, earning 1 point per tap. The user must achieve a score of at least 30 points within 60 seconds to qualify for a reward.

####Failure Outcome: If the user fails to score 30 points, they will be redirected to the "Lost Game" page, where they can try again to reach the required score.
####Success Outcome: Upon reaching 30 points, the user is rewarded with a chance to win an item from the CS case. The user is then directed to the roulette page for a free spin.
####Roulette Spin: After clicking the free spin button, the user will be taken to the roulette page, where a random skin is awarded.
